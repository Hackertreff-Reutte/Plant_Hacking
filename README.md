# Plant_Hacking

This is a project that uses different sensors and actuators to manage and
monitor plants. The main goal of the project is to create an overengineered
system that can almost autonomously grow plants.
So far we plan to monitor the following things:

* Light-Levels
* Humidity
* Temperature
* Ground-Moisture

we also plan to control:

* Watering
* Light


The project is split into two parts. The software side of the project and the
hardware (PCB, Schematics) side.

## Documentation

For the documentation we use [Obsidian](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-releases).

<br>

## Current Goal

At the moment we are trying to create the schematics for the
various subsystems (light, temp-sensor, ...)
